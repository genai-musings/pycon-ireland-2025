## Title : GitHub - There is an Action for That

Automation and efficiency are key to successful delivery of Python projects via DevOps.GitHub Actions provides a powerful, flexible way to automate workflows directly in GitHub repositories, streamlining development process and enhancing productivity. This session will delve into the world of GitHub Actions, providing a comprehensive understanding of what they are, how to use them in your Python applications, their benefits in CI/CD pipelines and will show you how to create one.

The session will start with an introduction to GitHub Actions, explaining their core concepts and capabilities. It will explain how Actions can be used to automate tasks such as continuous integration, continuous deployment, and other routine operations, directly from a GitHub repository. It will also explore the marketplace of pre-built Actions, showcasing how to find and implement existing solutions to common automation needs in your Python applications.

The session will also include a live demo showing the creation of a custom GitHub Action from scratch. This practical demonstration will cover writing the Action code, setting up the workflow file, and integrating the Action into a CI/CD pipeline of a Python application.
